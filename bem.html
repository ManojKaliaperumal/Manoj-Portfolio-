                <p>A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future either a resolved
                    value, or a reason that it’s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). </p>
                <p>A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can
                    attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.</p>
                <p>Promises are eager, meaning that a promise will start doing whatever task you give it as soon as the
                    promise constructor is invoked</p>

                <h1 id="h1-blogs">How Promises Work</h1>
                <p>A promise is an object which can be returned synchronously from an asynchronous function. It will be
                    in one of 3 possible states:
                </p>
                <p><strong>Fulfilled</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Rejected</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Pending</strong></p>
                <p>A promise is settled if it’s not pending (it has been resolved or rejected). Sometimes people use
                    resolved and settled to mean the same thing: not pending.</p>

                <h1 id="h1-blogs">Important Promise Rules</h1>
                <p>A promise or “thenable” is an object that supplies a standard-compliant .then() method.</p>

                <p>A pending promise may transition into a fulfilled or rejected state.</p>

                <p>A fulfilled or rejected promise is settled, and must not transition into any other state.</p>
                <p>Both onFulfilled() and onRejected() are optional.</p>
                <p>If the arguments supplied are not functions, they must be ignored.</p>
                <p>If onFulfilled() or onRejected() return a value x, and x is a promise, promise2 will lock in with
                    (assume the same state and value as) x. Otherwise, promise2 will be fulfilled with the value of x.
                </p>
                <p>Change in this context refers to identity (===) comparison. An object may be used as the fulfilled
                    value, and object properties may mutate.</p>

                <h1 id="h1-blogs">How Do I Cancel a Promise?</h1>

                <p>One of the first things new promise users often wonder about is how to cancel a promise. Here’s an
                    idea: Just reject the promise with “Cancelled” as the reason. If you need to deal with it
                    differently than a “normal” error, do your branching in your error handler.</p>
                <p>Adding .cancel() makes the promise non-standard, but it also violates another rule of promises: Only
                    the function that creates the promise should be able to resolve, reject, or cancel the promise.
                    Exposing it breaks that encapsulation, and encourages people to write code that manipulates the
                    promise in places that shouldn't know about it. Avoid spaghetti and broken promises.</p>

            <h1 id="h1-blogs">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>Promises have become an integral part of several idioms in JavaScript, including the WHATWG Fetch
                standard used for most modern ajax requests, and the Async Functions standard used to make asynchronous
                code look synchronous.</p>
