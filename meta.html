                <p>Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in
                    webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look.</p>
                <p>Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents.</p>

                <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
                </p>
                <p>Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search
                    rankings.</p>
                <p>Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page.</p>
                <p>Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or
                    without semantic or namespaced classes.</p>

                <h1 id="h1-blogs">Why should you use Semantic Tags?</h1>
                <p>The benefit of writing semantic HTML stems from what should be the driving goal of any web page: the
                    desire to communicate. By adding semantic tags to your document, you provide additional information
                    about that document, which aids in communication.</p>

                <p>Specifically, semantic tags make it clear to the browser what the meaning of a page and its content
                    is. That clarity is also communicated with search engines, ensuring that the right pages are
                    delivered for the right queries.</p>

                <h1 id="h1-blogs">Semantic Tag Best Practices</h1>
                <P>When using semantic tags to convey meaning rather than for presentation purposes, be careful that you
                    don't use them incorrectly simply for their common display properties. Some of the most commonly
                    misused semantic tags include:</P>

                            <h2 id="h2-blogs">Blockquote Tags</h2>
                            <p>blockquote — Some people use the <strong>blockquote</strong> tag for indenting text that
                                is not a
                                quotation. This is because blockquotes are indented by default. If you simply want
                                to indent text that's not a blockquote, use CSS margins instead.</p>

                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-ordered">

                            <h2 id="h2-blogs"> Paragraph Tags</h2>
                            <p>Some web editors use a non-breaking space contained in a paragraph to add
                                extra space between page elements, rather than defining actual paragraphs for the text
                                of that page. we should use the margin or padding style
                                property instead to add space.​</p>

                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-ordered">
                        <div>
                            <h2 id="h2-blogs">Unordered List Tags</h2>
                            <p>As with blockquote, enclosing text inside a <strong>unordered list </strong> tag indents
                                that text in most
                                browsers. This is both semantically incorrect and invalid HTML, because only
                                list tags are valid within a unordered list tag. Again, use the margin or padding style
                                to
                                indent text.
                            </p>

                            <h2 id="h2-blogs">h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6</h2>
                            <p>You can use heading tags to make fonts bigger and bolder, but if the text is not a
                                heading, use the font-weight and font-size CSS properties instead.</p>

                            <p>The section tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or
                                any other sections of the document.</p>
                            <p> The article tag specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should make
                                sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest
                                of the site. </p>

                <h1 id="h1-blogs">Conclusion</h1>
                <p>An important principle in web design is the idea of using HTML elements to indicate what they
                    actually are, rather than how they may appear in the browser by default. This is known as using
                    semantic HTML.
                    By using HTML tags that have meaning, you create pages that impart more information than those that
                    simply surround everything with <strong>div</strong> tags </p>
