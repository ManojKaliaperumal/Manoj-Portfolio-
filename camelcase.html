                <p>CamelCase is a naming convention in which a name is formed of multiple words that are joined together
                    as a single word with the first letter of each of the multiple words capitalized so that each word
                    that makes up the name can easily be read. </p>
                <p>he name derives from the hump or humps that seem to appear in any CamelCase name. In UpperCamelCase,
                    the first letter of the new word is upper case, allowing it to be easily distinguished from a
                    lowerCamelCase name, in which the first letter of the first name is lower case. </p>
                <p>The advantage of CamelCase is that in any computer system where the letters in a name have to be
                    contiguous (no spaces), a more meaningful name can be created using a descriptive sequence of words
                    without violating the naming limitation.</p>

                <h1 id="h1-blogs">Why is JavaScript in CamelCase? </h1>

                <p>CamelCase is a naming convention in which the first letter of each word in a compound word is
                    capitalized, except for the first word. Software developers often use camelCase when writing source
                    code.</p>
                <p>CamelCase is useful in programming since element names cannot contain spaces. The camelCase naming
                    convention makes compound names more readable. For example, myOneMethod is easier to read than
                    myonemethod.</p>

                <h1 id="h1-blogs">CamelCase vs PascalCase</h1>
                <p>camelCase is similar to PascalCase, which capitalizes the first letters of all words in a compound
                    word, including the first word.</p>
                <p>For example, myFunction() in PascalCase would be MyFunction(). Programmers may choose to use either
                    font case when writing source code, since it does not affect the syntax. While each developer can
                    choose his or her preferred style, some programming languages have standard naming conventions.</p>

                <p>PascalCase is sometimes called <strong>"UpperCamelCase,"</strong> while standard camelCase may be
                    specified as
                    <strong>"lowerCamelCase."</strong> In recent years, developers have moved away from these terms and
                    use PascalCase
                    and camelCase instead.</p>

                <h1 id="h1-blogs">3. Create your function components in the right order</h1>
                <P>When you create class components, there is a certain ordering that optimizes the way you maintain and
                    improve your React application code.</P>
                <p>First, you call the constructor and initiate your state. Then, you write the lifecycle functions,
                    followed by any functions relevant to the component’s job. Finally, you write the render method.</p>
                <p>When writing function components, there is no constructor and lifecycle function, so you might be
                    confused because the structure isn’t as enforced as in a class component.</p>
                <p>But just like with class components, creating a defined structure for your function components will
                    help your project’s readability.</p>
                <p>It’s recommended to first declare state variables with useState hook, then write the subscriptions
                    with useEffect hook followed by any function relevant to the component’s job.</p>
                <p>Then finally, you return the elements to be rendered by the browser.</p>

                <p>Camel case is an important accessibility requirement.

                    Screen readers cannot identify the individual words in a hashtag without camel case. This means the
                    content will be inaccessible to users of screen readers.</p>
                <p>This could be a significant proportion of your audience. Lots of people use screen readers,
                    including:</p>

                <p>– Blind people</p>
                <p>– Dyslexic people</p>
                <p>– People who are partially sighted</p>
                <p>– People who wish to lighten their reading load </p>
                <p>– People who like the experience of using a screen reader</p>
                <p>Camel case improves understanding and accessibility for everyone.</p>
